# English-Language-Character-Generator
This is my deep learning project where I used a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to create an English language character generator model.
It is capable of building semi-coherent English sentences from screatch, by building them character-by-character.
The dataset used was the complete version of J. K. Rowling's book, Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone.
I carried out data preprocessing before building, training, testing, then lastly, evaluating my models.
My model is able to identify 10 different types of food images, come take a look!
